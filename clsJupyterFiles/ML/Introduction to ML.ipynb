    "- Prediction — Machine learning can also be used in the prediction systems. Considering the loan example, to compute the probability of a fault, the system will need to classify the available data in groups.\n",
    "- Image recognition — Machine learning can be used for face detection in an image as well. There is a separate category for each person in a database of several people.\n",
    "- Speech Recognition — It is the translation of spoken words into the text. It is used in voice searches and more. Voice user interfaces include voice dialing, call routing, and appliance control. It can also be used a simple data entry and the preparation of structured documents.\n",
    "- Medical diagnoses — ML is trained to recognize cancerous tissues.\n",
