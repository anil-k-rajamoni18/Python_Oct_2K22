    "- Python is a computer programming language often used to build websites and software, automate tasks, and conduct data analysis. \n",
    "- Python is a general purpose language, meaning it can be used to create a variety of different programs and isn’t specialized for any specific problems. \n",
    "- This versatility, along with its beginner-friendliness, has made it one of the most-used programming languages today. \n",
    "- A survey conducted by industry analyst firm RedMonk found that it was the most popular programming language among developers in 2020 [1].\n",
